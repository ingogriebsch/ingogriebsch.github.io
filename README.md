User related Github Page site for my account.

Content is mostly adapated from Benedikt Ritter's [Github Page site](https://github.com/britter/britter.github.io) (kudos to him). Need to get the time to have a detailed look into [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to probably cleanup and simplify the structure.
